# What We Learned
- How to use our limited python knowledge to code a robot (ev3).
- We learned how to work around our materials.

# What Worked Well
- Even though we struggled with it at first, we maganged to play Thriller fairly accurately. We were proud of ourselves.
- We worked together collaboratively and productively while writing the code and building our robot.
- Our sensor was reliable and our robot always worked.

# What We Would Do Differently
- We could've tried to make a thread and have our robot spinning while playing at the same time.
- We could've worked with only one motor, but we thought it would be easier to use two.
